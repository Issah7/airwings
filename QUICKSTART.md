## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "No interfaces found"
```bash
Solution: Interface Management → [1] List Interfaces
• Check USB connections
• Install proper drivers
• Try different USB port
• Use lsusb to verify device detection
```

### "Monitor mode failed"
```bash
Solution: Interface Management → [3] Enable Monitor Mode
• Kill interfering processes: airmon-ng check kill
• Check VIF support: iw list | grep "AP/VLAN"
• Try different adapter if no VIF support
```

### "Evil Twin AP not starting"
```bash
Solution: Check VIF capability
• Only Atheros/Ralink chipsets support VIF
• Realtek (RTL) adapters won't work for Evil Twin
• Use Hardware Guide for adapter recommendations
```

### "Handshake not captured"
```bash
Solution: Increase deauth efforts
• Target specific client instead of broadcast
• Move closer to target
• Try different deauth method (mdk4 vs aireplay)
• Check if target uses 802.11w protection
```

### "Hashcat not using GPU"
```bash
Solution: Install proper drivers
• NVIDIA: sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470
• AMD: sudo apt install amdgpu-pro
• Verify: hashcat -I (should show GPU)
```

### "ESP8266 not responding"
```bash
Solution: Check serial connection
• Verify USB drivers (CH340, CP2102)
• Check device permissions: sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
• Try different port or USB cable
```

## 🔒 Safety Checklist

Before any attack, ensure:

- [ ] **Written authorization** from network owner
- [ ] **Defined scope** and time windows
- [ ] **Interface compatibility** (VIF support for Evil Twin)
- [ ] **Backup configurations** before changes
- [ ] **Legal compliance** verified for jurisdiction
- [ ] **Emergency procedures** in place

During attacks:

- [ ] **Monitor for unintended effects** on non-target systems
- [ ] **Stop immediately** if unauthorized systems affected
- [ ] **Document all activities** with timestamps
- [ ] **Respect time limitations** and scope boundaries
- [ ] **Protect privacy** of any captured data

After testing:

- [ ] **Restore original configurations**
- [ ] **Secure captured data** (encrypt, limited access)
- [ ] **Generate detailed report** with findings
- [ ] **Disclose vulnerabilities** responsibly
- [ ] **Clean up temporary files** and logs
